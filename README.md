Fastphoto
=========

A minimalistic and fast JavaScript photo viewer with infinite scroll for Flickr. Because Flickr's web UI is slow and clunky.

It has a [built in](https://github.com/shuw/fastphoto/blob/master/fastphoto.js) API client, renderer and infite scroll handler. See [a demo](http://shuw.github.com/photos).

Usage
=========

    // start fastphoto on {dom_element} for {user_name} using {api_key}
    fastphoto({dom_element}, {user_name}, {api_key})

To create a Flickr API key, follow [this link](http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply). It's quite easy.
